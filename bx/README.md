# Uncom

Uncom is a stack based language, where you can comment and uncomment things at runtime

## Setup
You'll need ruby installed to run Uncom, you'll also need [ruby-sdl2](https://rubygems.org/gems/ruby-sdl2) gem installed if you want to run any graphical programs

## Usage
Run ```ruby uncom.rb file.uncom``` to run a program, or just run ```ruby uncom.rb``` for the repl
I'd recommend reading ```tutorial.uncom``` and following along in the repl to get an idea of how it works
