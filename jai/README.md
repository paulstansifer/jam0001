# Jai

Unfortunately our team did not have time to complete our submission. However, we had tons of fun and learned a lot about lexical analysis and some of the basics and language creation. We will continue to work on our project [jai](https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/jai) outside of the langjam until it's complete. Any love and support for the project would be greatly appreciated.

Cheers,
Jake Roggenbuck
